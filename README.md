🔍 Research Projects Database – My First ER & SQL Project!
📍 NIAT Hyderabad | 🎓 1st Year Student

As part of my learning journey in database systems, I designed and implemented a Research Projects Database to efficiently manage data related to projects, employees, and funding agencies.

This involved designing a complete Entity-Relationship (ER) schema and writing SQL statements to create and populate tables with real-world relationships like project assignments, managers, and funding links.
